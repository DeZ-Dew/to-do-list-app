 To-Do List app using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

 •Hello and thank you for viewing my to-do list app, "Gotta Do-It". This is an app using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
 What motivated me to work on this project was to learn more about the JavaScript language. I learned to utilize functions
 that would load the data, create a new task, complete it, delete it and clear the list. 


•The role of the application is to enable the user to create a task list, mark off the tasks, and delete it. Within the header, it has a custom photo with the function to show the current date using the const declaration. While working on this app, the challeneges I faced were properly calling out the const declarations needed to be used and making sure the 
correct strings were used and matched what was being defined. A feature I would like to implement in the future is the option to email or save the task list. I think about the notes app on windows where you can add notes or still have them saved. Given the notes are saved to the localStorage, I feel it would be convenient to have afunction to recall past lists.

•This was a fun app to complete and I'm grateful to Code Explained to provide the tutorial and lesson to learn more
JavaScript.
